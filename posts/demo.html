                <h2>RANKING CRITERIA</h2>
                <p>The ranking for these languages is going to be based on 3 things:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>How easy the language is to learn.</li>
                    <li>How fast the code runs.</li>
                    <li>How useful the languages is.</li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <h2>5. Kotlin</h2>
                <p>Kotlin is a high-level language developed by <strong><a href="https://jetbrains.com"
                            target="_blank">JetBrains</a></strong>
                    to replace Java. The main purpose of Kotlin is android app development,
                    but it can still be used for other types of applications.</p>
                <p>While the syntax might not be as easy as some of the other languages on this list,
                    Kotlin is still a very good language to learn,
                    especially if you're interested in android app development.</p>
                <h3>Pros:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Better Than Java</li>
                    <li>Best Language For Android Development</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Cons:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Slower Than Java</li>
                    <li>Not The Best Outside Android Development</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h2>4. C</h2>
                <p>While C might not be the newest language on the market,
                    it remains one of the most important programming languages in the world to this day.</p>
                <p>C is known for its easy syntax and optimal performance.
                    However, It's quite rare to see C being used in most modern programming fields
                    such as web, desktop or mobile app development, as it's mostly used in
                    systems and low-level applications that interact with hardware,
                    such as embedded systems, operating systems or programming languages.</p>
                <p>However, it's still useful for the average developer to have some basic knowledge of C.</p>
                <h3>Pros:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Simple Syntax</li>
                    <li>Optimal Performance</li>
                    <li>Hardware Access</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Cons:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>No OOP</li>
                    <li>Limited Libraries for High-level Applications</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h2>3. C++</h2>
                <p>C++ is a superset of C.
                    It provides classes along with more libraries and frameworks
                    for all kinds of applications, all of that while maintaining
                    the same performance and hardware access as C.</p>
                <p>From operating systems to video games to mobile apps,
                    you can make absolutely anything with C++.</p>
                <p>The only downside of C++ is the difficult syntax and steep learning curve
                    compared to C.</p>
                <h3>Pros:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Can Be Used For Everything</li>
                    <li>Optimal Performance</li>
                    <li>Hardware Access</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Cons:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Difficult Syntax & Steep Learning Curve</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h2>2. C#</h2>
                <p>C# (pronounced C-Sharp) is a language created by <strong>Microsoft</strong>.
                    Its syntax is very similar to Java, but you can do a lot more with it than Java.</p>
                <p>It's the main language for developing apps for Microsoft platforms,
                    such as <strong>Windows</strong>. But you can also use it for game development
                    with the <strong>Unity</strong> engine, backend web development with <strong>ASP.NET</strong>,
                    or cross-platform development with <strong>.NET MAUI</strong>.</p>
                <h3>Pros:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Can Be Used For Everything</li>
                    <li>High Performance</li>
                    <li>Best Language For Windows</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Cons:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Steep Learning Curve</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h2>1. Javascript</h2>
                <p>Javascript is the core programming language for the web.</p>
                <p>There are countless libraries in Javascript that are
                    designed to make web development easier. There are also libraries that
                    extend the functionality of Javascript to include other types of applications,
                    such as <strong>Electron.js</strong> for desktop app development,
                    <strong>React Native</strong> for cross-platform mobile app development,
                    and <strong>Node.js</strong> for backend development.
                </p>
                <p>Overall, Javascript is one of the most important programming languages that
                    should be in any developer's toolkit.</p>
                <h3>Pros:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Main Language For The Web</li>
                    <li>Can Be Used For Other Things</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Cons:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Very Confusing Syntax</li>
                </ul>
